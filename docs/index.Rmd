##### Let's calculate some statistics for the dashboard

# How many unique volunteers were there?
# Count up distinct number of names
# Then add extra volunteers, in cases when the group size was >1
number_unique_volunters <-
  n_distinct(watershed_brigade_data_processed$Name) +
  sum(watershed_brigade_data_processed$add_multiple_volunteers,
      na.rm=TRUE)

# How many pounds of trash were cleaned up?
number_pounds_trash <- sum(watershed_brigade_data_processed$weight_pounds,
                           na.rm=TRUE) %>%
  # Round this
  round()

# How many unique cleanup events were there?
number_volunteer_events <- n_distinct(watershed_brigade_data_processed$cleanup_event_id)
```
